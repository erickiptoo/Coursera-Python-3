#1 Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It doesnâ€™t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast, or .speed(0) for it to draw super fast with no animation.)
import turtle
wn=turtle.Screen()

eric=turtle.Turtle()
eric.shape("turtle")
eric.speed(0)
d=10
a=5
for i in range(300):

    eric.speed(0)
    eric.forward(30)
    eric.left(4)
    eric.forward(20)
    eric.right(80)
    eric.forward(50)

#2Write a program that extracts the last three items in the list sports and assigns it to the variable last. Make sure to write your code so that it works no matter how many items are in the list.

sports = ['cricket', 'football', 'volleyball', 'baseball', 'softball', 'track and field', 'curling', 'ping pong', 'hockey']

last=sports[-3:]
